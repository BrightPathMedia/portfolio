JapanWifiBuddy began as a side business in late-2014. Seeing a need for travelers coming to Japan having difficulties staying connected to the internet affordably, the owner started out slowly accumulating and renting pocket wifi devices to travelers coming in to Japan. After a half-year they decided to start a Shopify store, where the shop continued to grow for another year or so.<br><br>Shopify’s guided and railed system proved to be a good place to start, but JWB’s administrative needs grew with their customer base. Without methods for holding deposits from clients, or charging clients who damaged devices (among other specific needs), it became clear that a new system was necessary. Shopify is designed to run e-commerce for selling one-off products—JWB is a system requiring recirculation of rented products needed a tailored solution.<br><br>BrightPath teamed up with x47d to build up an entirely custom client-and-device management system which comfortably overcame these difficulties, allowing for breathing room and growth in various other aspects. Sine our implementation of our business solution, JWB saw growth of over 400%.<br><br>As a growing rental company, managing the constantly circulating devices traveling around the world became a challenge after about 100 units. Not only tracking their location, but also accurately tracking lifespan, rental history, usage rates, profit rates (after deducting lease expenses) and other such minutiae. Our solution was a booking system that allows clients to determine available for their desired dates, and allows for a smooth and snappy ordering process. This system also secures a more smooth inventory flow, avoiding superfluous leasing fees while also having sufficient supply for peak seasons.<br><br>Keeping track of various clients’ needs, rental history, personal information and payment data is also crucial for thorough service and record keeping. The previous system on Shopify provided basic information, but JWB needs to track much more minute and detailed information, in a many-to-many relationship fashion. We also included Stripe for more intricate and able charging methods such as charging for lost or damaged routers. JWB also has numerous long-term renters who request to pay monthly rather than up-front, which we accommodated.<br><br>Inventory forecasting is invaluable for travel-related businesses subject to seasonality. We built an inventory availability forecasting system for JWB, allowing them to see how many units of each device are currently available for rent at any date in the future. If they see a peak season approaching with low availability, they can increase the amount of stock on hand to prepare and maximize profitability.<br><br>One of the most complex and intricate difficulties JWB faces is managing all of the shipping locations and their work hours. Their clients arrive at any number of airports, where they’re able to pick up their WifiBuddy at one of numerous shipping offices. All of these offices have different hours of availability and require different fees for usage as well. We’ve built a robust logic system that takes in the client’s flight information, arrival times and terminal information, then filters it through the shipping logic, which part of the smooth 3-step ordering process we’ve put together.<br><br> If the client will be able to pick the package up at the free shipping location, it will prioritize that option, but in many cases for later flights or overnight flights, a shipping upgrade is required. In this case the system charges the client the appropriate upgrade fee and informs the shipping staff which specific office to ship to.<br><br>Once ordering is complete,  the system automatically emails a map of the correct terminal and pickup location to the client, and the staff apply the tracking number and such for the client. This process alone saves WifiBuddy significant amounts of research, client back-and-forth and communication mishaps on every single order.<br><br>We integrated a super-rapid spreadsheet-based pricing editor which allows the managers to change every single parameter within seconds. This allows them to capitalize on seasonality and demand.<br><br>We’ve also built in an insurance system for JapanWifiBuddy which gives clients peace-of-mind to avoid damage fees, and also provides some stability for JapanWifiBuddy. The insurance fee is based on the length of the rental, commensurate with the amount of risk of damaging or losing the device.<br><br><br><br>“You can’t improve what you can’t measure.” Words to live by for any entrepreneur or manager. Seeing JapanWifiBuddy’s needs, we decided to put together a robust reporting system. All fields are viewable by day, month or year, and some are also viewable as “All time”.<br><br>We can expand data tracking if necessary, but some of the features they’ve requested us to display are the following:<br>-Full income (by device/area), expense, profit reporting.<br>-Device revenue charts showing cost, revenue, profit for each device.<br>-Website visits, conversion rates, referrers, browser/device types.<br>-Feeler report and functionality for determining what types of new products to launch. -Order data - average rental length, average rental price, insurance inclusion percentage, average rentals in device life, lifetime revenue, etc.<br>-Deposits in-hand<br><br>Additional on-request functionality we’ve added for ease-of-management include<br>-Admin/user management for control panels.<br>-Blackout date management for holiday periods or team traveling periods.<br>-Editable notification bar for marketing or sales on the top of the front page. <br><br>Abhishek’s site : http://www.x47d.com/showcase/japanwifibuddy
